  <h1>Chapter 1</h1>

  <p class="capital">
    Raven stretched in the early morning light. Nevermore, her raven, preened himself on a rock
    nearby. Sliding into her boots, she noticed that Sparklefly, her pet wyvern, still slept near the fire. He
    looked so sweet asleep, even though lightning popped from his skin in little bolts. Standing, she slowly
    worked her way around the camp checking for things out of place and deftly packing to leave. She
    traveled light so she was ready to go in a matter of minutes. Her longbow and quiver were checked for
    damage. She couldn’t afford to be weaponless. Her few tools and clothes were packed away in her rucksack.

    “Nevermore, see if you can wake sleeping beauty, please,” she told the bird as she finailzed
    her checklist. The raven lit on the wyvern’s back and began walking towards his head. Pecking the
    back of his head, Nevermore tried to coax Sparklefly awake.
