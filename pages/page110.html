    “In two days. I am waiting for Trauma to get back from Lion’s Arch. Then we will take the next
    pact airship back to Fort Vandal, and get out into the field as soon as we can,” Vayne explained.
  </p>

  <p>“Lion’s Arch? What is Trauma doing there?” Aura asked.</p>

  <p>
    With a knowing smirk, Vayne only said, “He’s going to get guildies. Ones that have skills almost
    as good as yours.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Nodding, Aura snapped his fingers, and his glamour reappeared. Winking at Vayne, Aura tossed
    her hair over her shoulders. “Two days. I have plenty of time to enjoy myself. Loosen up, Vayne. Let’s
    have some fun.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “Let’s have fun, he says,” Vayne muttered as she followed the mesmer through the crowd. The
    fight growing outside would have to wait for the time being.
  </p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>
    Trauma left Vayne near the entrance to Divinity’s Reach, and strode off to the city center. He
    wasn’t sure if they restricted travel between the cities after dark, and he wanted to make sure he made
    it to Lion’s Arch tonight. Passing by the merchants and then the bank, Trauma soon entered the heart of
    the city and made his way to the asura gate. There was no guard on duty, and Trauma stepped into the
    gate. Instantly, he was standing in Lion’s Arch, in the Eastern Ward. “No matter how many times I use
    one of those things…” Trauma left the thought unfinished as he headed out of the plaza that held the
    asura gates. Making his way towards Postern Ward, Trauma took a left onto the small lane. It led to a
    small inn, and Trauma knew he would find a nice quiet place there to spend the night.
  </p>

  <p>
    Lion’s Shadow Inn was plain and tucked away against a rock wall. “Quiet, just the way I like it,”
    Trauma thought as he reached the front door. Entering, he took in his surroundings and saw that most
    of the travelers were near the bar. Reaching the bar, he asked for rum and a room.
  </p>

  <p>“A room, I can help you with,” the barkeep said, “but sadly, I am all out of rum.”</p>

  <p>“Mmmmwwww, fine. Just give me what you have. Some bread as well, if you have it.”</p>

  <p>
    Nodding, the barkeep sat a pint and a large crust of bread in front of Trauma. Munching on the
    bread, he sipped his pint, listening to the noise around him. Interesting bits of information reached his
    ears from all directions. Trauma kept his head low until the barkeep laid a key on the bar. Thanking the
    man, Trauma paid his bill and headed upstairs to find his room for the night.
  </p>

  <p>
    Once in a room, Trauma set his gear aside, removed his traveling coat, and slowly placed each
    weapon on the table. He arranged them all to his liking, evenly spaced, as if he were giving them a
    resting place for the night. Sitting on the edge of the bed, he removed his shoes and lie back on the bed.
    He clasped his hands over his chest with his dagger firmly in hand. He lay perfectly still, akin to a vampire
    in his coffin. Sleeping soundly, he woke only when the sun fell across his face. Grumbling, Trauma placed
    his dagger beside him on the bed as he sat up. “I just went to sleep. Does it have to be morning already?
    Better question…do you have to be so damn bright?” he tossed at the sunlight. Not getting a reply,
    Trauma grumbled once more before tugging his shoes on.
  </p>

  <p>
    Gathering all of his weapons and gear, Trauma descended the stairs and left the inn. Continuing
    across the way into Postern Ward, he searched for the Guild Initiative Headquarters. “Someone has to
    have coffee. Don’t care who, just need coffee,” Trauma muttered to himself as he climbed the stairs into
    the office. Strangers moved out of his way as he entered the office. Entering the first door on the right,
    Trauma walked into Grimur Oddursson’s office. The norn seemed to sense Trauma coming, and
    extended his hand. In front of Trauma was a steaming mug of coffee, just the way Trauma liked it…black
    as his necrotic heart. Grimur didn’t speak until Trauma had finished the mug and looked up with a
    satisfied smile.
  </p>

  <p>“So what brings you to Lion’s Arch this time, Trauma? Other than my coffee,” the norn asked.</p>

  <p>
    “Business. I’m looking for some friends of mine. My guildmates. Have you seen any of them
    lately?”
  </p>

  <p>
    “You have quite a few people in Cthulhu Dawn, Trauma. Could you narrow it down just a little?”
    he asked.
  </p>

  <p>
    “I am looking for Alex, Serina, and Isomeik to be exact. Have you seen a charr, a big norn with a
    pet, and a tiny human necromancer by any chance?” Trauma replied.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Can’t say that I have, but then again, I rarely leave this office. Try near the center of town. I
    heard there were some folks hanging out there. Maybe it’s your friends.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “Thanks, Grimur. I’ll check it out. Coffee was great as always,” Trauma said as he turned and left
    the building. Trauma crossed the bridge back towards the Eastern Ward. Passing the gateways to the
    other Tyrian cities, Trauma walked on towards the bank. The bank was shaped like an octopus, and it
    always made Trauma smile to know that Lion’s Arch had a built in Cthulhu. Looking around, he saw so
    many people crossing the square. After a while, Trauma grew tired of searching through all of the
    strangers. Walking across the plaza, he entered the crafting area. Tradesmen were hard at work making
    weapons and armor. Food prepared by apprentice chefs was being offered for sale. Trauma purchased a
    plate of truffle steak, and wandered over to a grassy spot near the mystic forge.
  </p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>
    Once seated near the mystic forge, Trauma munched on his steak, and studied the people
    milling about. Several small children ran around him screaming, “I want to be Marjorie. Then I’m
    Kasmeer.” Sneering at the children if they came too close, Trauma finished his food, and began to walk
    closer to the forge. The mystic forge looked like any other fountain in Lion’s Arch except there was no
    water in it. Instead, a magic current flowed upward into a point above the center of the fountain. People
    often tossed items into the fountain just to see what the magic would give them in return. Children
    playing near the mystic forge hopped in the edge, and Trauma watched with a small amount of glee as
    the forge hurtled them back out.
  </p>

  <p>
    As Trauma walked around the outside of the forge, he saw a familiar figure. He stopped and
    watched as the man continued to throw things into the forge. After three attempts, the man cheered,
    “Woo hoo. Sigil of Force. Next.” The next five attempts were successful as well, and the man continued
    testing his luck against the forge until his backpack was empty. Standing up, the man noticed Trauma.
  </p>

  <p>“Well, hey, Trauma. Been here long?” Rock asked with a grin.</p>

  <p>“Long enough to see your luck is still strong,” Trauma said with frown. “Hey to you too.”</p>

  <p>
    “What brings you to my part of town?” Rock inquired. “I didn’t think you were friends with the
    mystic toilet, I mean forge.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “No, I am most certainly not friends with the mystic toilet. Fucker always cheats me. I want my
    PRE!” Trauma said as he kicked a rock at the forge in annoyance. The rock bounced into the forge only
    to come hurtling back out. Trauma moved just before the rock had a chance to hit him.
  </p>

  <p>Chuckling, Rock said, “I don’t think you should put anything else into the forge.”</p>

  <p>Glaring at Rock, he answered, “Nope. So where are you headed now?”</p>

  <p>
    “Well, I’m going to head over to the Trading Post and buy some more things to put in the forge
    over there,” Rock said with a sheepish grin. “I’m feeling rather lucky at the moment.”
  </p>

  <p>“Mind if I walk with you?”</p>

  <p>“Of course not.”</p>

  <p>
    The two men walked in silence towards the Trading Post. Trauma paced in slow circles near the
    entrance as Rock picked up his purchases. Scanning the ebbing crowds, he still saw no sign of the
    guildies that Vayne promised were here. When Rock was ready, they began the walk back towards the
    mystic forge. Quaggans splashed in a fountain near the crafting stations. Children ran through the
    crowding shoving and playing. People milled about as the daylight began to fade in Lion’s Arch. When
    they reached the mystic forge, Rock sat on the edge and opened his bag. Trauma sat a little bit back,
    careful not to get anything near the forge. Rock began throwing small sigils into the forge again.
  </p>

  <p>
    “So, Trauma, if you don’t mind me asking, what ARE you doing here in Lion’s Arch? Not often we
    see you here,” Rock remarked.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Guild business,” Trauma said looking around. Leaning closer to Rock, he whispered, “There is
    an ugly problem out near Silverwastes, and we’ve been asked to take care of it. Was looking for Alex and
    a couple others when I ran into you.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “Ah. Hadn’t heard anything about that, but I don’t think I would have since I rarely leave the
    toilet. Though I did see Alex a couple days ago. He’s normally over there near that quaggan fountain.
    Seems to like them.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “Thanks, I’ll check there tomorrow. It’s getting late, and I saw no one there today,” Trauma
    answered. “I guess I will head back to the inn, and try again tomorrow. Good luck with the forge. Not
    that you seem to need it.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “Thanks, Trauma. I take all the luck I can get, even yours,” Rock grinned as he tossed four small
    daggers into the forge. After a few seconds, the forge tossed a small dagger back in his lap. Picking it up,
    he noticed the markings and the way it seemed to glow with an inner fire. “Well, I’ll be damned. I got a
    Spark!” Rock beamed as he held it up for Trauma to see.
  </p>

  <p>
    Trauma shook his head, unable to believe Rock’s luck yet again. “Sharing is caring,” he said with
    a grin.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Sharing IS caring. Have a sigil, Trauma,” Rock smiled as he placed a sigil of force in Trauma’s
    palm. “Today IS my lucky day.” With that, Rock strode off to the Trading Post to cash in on his good
    fortune. Trauma made his way back to the inn, the sigil of force in his pocket. Maybe some of the luck
    would rub off on him, and he could find the missing guildies in the morning. He wasn’t known for his
    patience, and it was growing shorter by the hour.
  </p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>
    Trauma rose the next morning much the way he had the morning before. The sunlight was not
    his friend, and he made sure that it was understood between them. He saw the barkeep as he
    descended the stairs, the smell of coffee hitting his nose. Without a word, the barkeep placed a mug of
    steaming black coffee on the bar, and walked away. Trauma enjoyed the coffee, left a tip, and strode
    out of the inn determined to find his prey.
  </p>

  <p>
    The walk back across to Trader’s Forum, the crafting area near the mystic forge, was much the
    same as the day before. Too many children, too many people, and the sun was way too bright. Just as he
    passed the bank, Trauma heard someone call his name.
  </p>

  <p>“Yo, Trauma. Hey, Trauma. Over here, Trauma,” came the voice.</p>

  <p>
    Trauma turned towards the voice and saw before him a purple plant, well, sylvari. “Do I know
    you?” he asked.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Really, Trauma? You’ve forgotten me already? I’m Ian, Ian Blinktread. Raven’s ward,” he
    answered. Grinning, he threw his hand up to give Trauma a high five.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ignoring the hand, Trauma walked around Ian, and answered, “Owe, I do remember you. You
    are the little fucker who wouldn’t stop drawing a target on me the last time we were with Raven. How
    could I forget,” he finished with a grimace.
  </p>

  <p>
    “See? You do remember me,” the young sylvari seemed unfazed by Trauma’s reaction. “Soooo,
    whatcha doing in LA? Can I draw target on you again?”
  </p>

  <p>
    “NO, you cannot draw target on me again…oh, wait, Raven isn’t here to protect you, so go
    ahead. Go go go. Draw target. Let’s see where it gets you,” Trauma said with a wicked grin.
  </p>

  <p>
    Suddenly the sylvari disappeared and Trauma spun around looking in all directions. He
    reappeared on one of the tentacles that held up the bank. “No thanks. I changed my mind. Soooo
    whatcha doing in LA?” Ian asked again.
  </p>

  <p>
    “If you must know, I am here looking for some guild members for an important job. Have you
    seen Alex, Serina, or Isomeik lately?”
  </p>

  <p>
    “Well, Serina left LA months ago. She had some norn thing to do. So I can take her place. As for
    Alex and Isomeik, yeah, I see them every day. Was actually on my way to them when I spotted you. You
    can come with me now, if you want.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Nodding, Trauma motioned for the sylvari to lead the way. Ian led Trauma over to the fountains
    near the crafters. In the middle, there was a fountain with quaggans splashing about. Trauma
    remembered the fountain from the day before. Looking around, he saw no sign of the charr or human
    he sought. Turning to Ian, he said, “I thought you said they were here. Rock even told me yesterday that
    Alex frequents this quaggan fountain, but I see no sign of him. Explain.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “Oh they are here, Trauma. They are right in front of you,” Ian replied seriously. “I don’t
    understand why you don’t see them.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Growing frustrated, Trauma looked around once more, but did not spot them. “I am only going
    to ask one more…” Trauma stopped mid-sentence. He had heard what he thought was charr laughter
    coming from behind him. Spinning around, he only saw two quaggans splashing in the water. A pink
    quaggan started at him while a blue quaggan with a turtle shell helmet continued to splash in the pool.
    Edging closer to the pond, Trauma began to reach for the pink quaggan.
  </p>

  <p>“Hey, Trauma…Trauma…did you see this Trauma?” Ian called.</p>

  <p>Turning towards him, Trauma asked, “Wuut wuut?”</p>

  <p>“Oh, nevermind, you missed it now,” Ian replied with an odd smile.</p>

  <p>
    Returning his attention to the fountain, Trauma realized that the pink quaggan had disappeared,
    and in its place, was a small tree. Shaking his head, Trauma looked again. There was a tree in the middle
    of the fountain with the blue quaggan dancing circles around it. Trauma heard laughter from the
    quaggan, but it sounded almost human. Moving quickly, Trauma grabbed the quaggan from the
    fountain, and brought it near his face. Still holding the quaggan, Trauma turned to Ian.
  </p>

  <p>“Does this quaggan look strange to you?” he asked.</p>

  <p>“Nope. Looks like a quaggan to me. All quaggans look the same to me, sorry,” Ian offered.</p>

  <p>
    As Trauma looked at the quaggan, it spoke. “Coooooo. Quaggan likes you,” it said followed by
    human sounding giggles. Trauma knew that voice. “Isomeik, is that you? What kind of trick is this?” he
    asked as he sat the quaggan back in the pond. The quaggan took a small sip from a bottle, and suddenly,
    Isomeik was sitting on the edge of the fountain where the quaggan had been. The tree also took a sip,
    and Alex soon stood where the tree had been. He trudged across the fountain to sit next to Isomeik.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Oh my goth. What have you people been doing?” Trauma asked. Suddenly, Trauma stopped.
    “Aquatic wildlife. They told me you guys were studying aquatic wildlife. ‘Girl talk’. Just those two wait til
    I get back. Oh my goth.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “Well, Traum, ya see we were technically studying aquatic wildlife, or at least how to look like
    them. Isn’t that right, Alex?” Isomeik answered with a grin. The charr, quiet in nature, only nodded in
    agreement. “Don’t be mad. We actually learned a lot of cool tricks with these tonics that we have. Alex
    can blend into any forest, Ian over there can run with the devourers, and the three of us can fool even
    you with our quaggan tonics. Can come in handy,” she said with a grin.
  </p>

  <p>
    “When has being a quaggan ever come in handy? Nevermind. I came here to get you guys. We
    have work to do now that I have you out of the kiddie pool,” Trauma said. “Think you can handle it?”
  </p>

  <p>“Depends, what’s the job?”</p>

  <p>
    Gritting his teeth, Trauma replied, “My job is not killing you three before we get back to Fort
    Vandal. Your jobs will be to come back with me so Vayne can explain about the bad guy we need to deal
    with, and that is all I am saying, so don’t ask.” He looked at the trio, and asked, “So, are you coming? Or
    should I tell everyone that you were too chicken to come?”
  </p>

  <p>Ian chimed in, “I’m coming. Sign me up. Can I draw target when needed?”</p>

  <p>Alex spoke quietly, “I’ll be there, Trauma. What do you need?”</p>

  <p>
    Nodding, Trauma accepted their pledges. “We need to leave for Divinity’s Reach soon. We’ll
    meet up with Vayne, and take an airship back to Fort Vandal. From there, we will make a plan. We’ll
    have everyone there to help so it should go smooth.” Looking to Isomeik, he says, “That just leaves you.
    Are you in?”
  </p>

  <p>Grinning from ear to ear, Isomeik responded, “Coooo, quaggan help you.”</p>
