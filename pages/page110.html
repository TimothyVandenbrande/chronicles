    “In two days. I am waiting for Trauma to get back from Lion’s Arch. Then we will take the next
    pact airship back to Fort Vandal, and get out into the field as soon as we can,” Vayne explained.

    her hair over her shoulders. “Two days. I have plenty of time to enjoy myself. Loosen up, Vayne. Let’s
    have some fun.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “Let’s have fun, he says,” Vayne muttered as she followed the mesmer through the crowd. The
    fight growing outside would have to wait for the time being.
