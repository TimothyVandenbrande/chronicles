    many people crossing the square. After a while, Trauma grew tired of searching through all of the
    strangers. Walking across the plaza, he entered the crafting area. Tradesmen were hard at work making
    weapons and armor. Food prepared by apprentice chefs was being offered for sale. Trauma purchased a
    plate of truffle steak, and wandered over to a grassy spot near the mystic forge.
