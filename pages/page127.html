    “Aquatic wildlife. They told me you guys were studying aquatic wildlife. ‘Girl talk’. Just those two wait til

    “Well, Traum, ya see we were technically studying aquatic wildlife, or at least how to look like
    them. Isn’t that right, Alex?” Isomeik answered with a grin. The charr, quiet in nature, only nodded in
    agreement. “Don’t be mad. We actually learned a lot of cool tricks with these tonics that we have. Alex
    can blend into any forest, Ian over there can run with the devourers, and the three of us can fool even
    you with our quaggan tonics. Can come in handy,” she said with a grin.

    “When has being a quaggan ever come in handy? Nevermind. I came here to get you guys. We
    have work to do now that I have you out of the kiddie pool,” Trauma said. “Think you can handle it?”
