<p>Trauma agreed to tell them, and turned to leave the room. 
Raven looked at Dam, searching his face. They shared a look as
 he nodded for her to follow Trauma. Raven silently slipped out
 behind their leader as he went to tell the guild. Once they were
 gone, Dam rose and stepped towards Vayne. </p>
 
 <p>“I didn’t want to say this in front of them, but there is a bit
 more, and I think you should know,” Dam said. </p>

 <p>“I want to spare them the pain,” he began. “Tibba won’t be coming back. 
 Ever. The healers told me that she is the worst case they’ve ever seen. 
 She will never regain her memory of anyone or anything. She will be sent back 
 home where she can live out the rest of her life, but she will never rejoin 
 us,” Dam said, his voice soft with sadness. “No longer one of us.”</p>
