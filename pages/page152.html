    That evening the members of Cthulhu Dawn gathered together to plan their mission.
	They had a good core group of people, and enough time had been lost. Dinner was 
	eaten in relative silence, with some whispering here and there. Once Vayne’s staff
	had cleared away the dishes, and left the tent, Vayne stood to address everyone.

    “I want to say thank you to everyone for coming here, and I also want to take this 
	time to step down. I have been coordinating the efforts thus far because I am commander
	here at Fort Vandal. I worked in my official capacity, but we will be leaving the Fort 
	soon enough, and we will be Cthulhu Dawn only. So, from now on, everything goes through
	Trauma, not me,” Vayne said. “Tyrian things will no longer matter out there,” she finished
	with a whisper as she sat back down.
