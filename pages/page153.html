    “Thank you, Vayne,” Trauma said from his seat. “I’m not gonna stand up and make speeches. 
	There is no time, or place, for those now. We have work to do, and I want to get to it. 
	Tonight, we plan and strategize enough to get us mobile in the morning. I want to move out.
	This threat is not waiting, and we shouldn’t either.  So, first things first, I want to see 
	if anyone has questions or concerns that must be addressed, then we’ll move on from there.”

    “My plan is to keep us together as much as possible. I know that a larger group attracts more
	attention, but since we do not know what kind of attention we will attract, I want us together.
