    had worked. “Now, let’s get moving. Trauma is pacing a rut in the dirt over 
	there. We’ll be able to plant potatoes in it before long.” They ladies
	giggled at the thought and gathered their things to leave.

    There were two paths leading away from the outcropping. One lead down to an 
	open area of more rock as far as the eye could see. The other lead the opposite
	direction through trees and, what they could only assume, was jungle. Once 
	everyone was gathered to leave, Trauma spoke. “Let’s take the path through the
	trees. I know that it will be a more difficult path, but I don’t like the idea 
	of being out in the open and easy targets for whatever is out here. Might as well
	even the playing field however we can,” he finished. The group nodded and murmured 
	their agreement as they headed off the rock. The path quickly narrowed, so they were
	forced to walk single file down the path.

    Soon, they were off the slope, and spread out on the flat land below. Strange plants
	were scattered before them. Herbs and trees that they had never encountered before. 
	Dam stopped to pick a sample from a flowering plant. Small beige seeds lay in the palm
	of his hand as he studied them. “Hmmmm,” he muttered to himself before tucking them 
	away in the pouch he carried at his waist. A little bit further, they came to a small 
	stream that was fed by a waterfall from the rock cliffs above. They stopped to rest 
	and allow the dolyaks to get water from the stream. Milling around the clearing, they
	examined the plants, rocks, and even small animals that they came across. Everything 
	was strange, but also a bit familiar and it was becoming unnerving.
