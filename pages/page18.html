    The path towards Hidden Lake was easy to follow but known to be full of bandits and raptors.
    Raven hurried as fast as she dared without alerting animal or human alike to her presence. The tactic
    was working fairly well until Sparklefly got the idea to chase a rabbit into the bushes. “Sparklefly, get
    your ass back here. You crazy wyvern. Where are you going now?” Raven hissed after her pet. Following
    him in the brush, she spotted him still hot on the trail of the rabbit. “Nevermore, fetch,” she
    commanded. Nevermore dashed forward, dove down and picked the baby rabbit up, returning to Raven
    with his prize. Just as Raven expected, Sparklefly chased Nevermore back determined to have the rabbit
    that he spotted first. “Nevermore, release.” He placed the rabbit down and watched proudly as it darted
    off. “Sparklefly, sit. Bad wyvern,” she barked as he tried to run again. Hanging his head, Sparklefly sat at
    her feet. Feeling bad for scolding him, Raven stooped and rubbed his chin.
