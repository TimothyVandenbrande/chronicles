  <p>“Raven? Is that you?” he replied.</p>
  <p>Laughing as she reached him, she answered, “Do you know any other ranger bouncing around with these kinda rascals?” motioning to her pets.

  <p>“No, can’t say that I do. I’m good. How are you? Come looking for Dam, haven’t you?”
</p>
  <p>“I’m good, and yes, I miss him and the others. Have you seen either of the other two?”

  <p>“Well, I heard tell that Vayne got stationed at Vandal’s Claim, on the edge of the Wastes, but I haven’t heard about Trauma lately. Sorry.”</p>
  <p>“Thanks, Aidem. I’m glad you know that much. Say hi to the wife and kids. I need to find me a couple wayward necros,” she smiled as she walked further into the camp.</p>
