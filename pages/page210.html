    Raven finished her lunch and went off in search of Daeron. Finding him cleaning and
    shining his sword blade, she stood and watched his methodical work. He cleaned the
    blade slowly, careful not to miss an inch. Once he finished, he looked up, and 
    noticed Raven standing there.

    “Well, hello, Miss…uh Raven. Hello, Raven,” he said. “Sorry, I didn’t notice you 
    standing there. Can I help you with something?”

    “No need to apologize. I was simply admiring your attention to detail as you worked.
    Yes, you can help me with something actually,” she began. “Wilton told us that you
    could come with us when we leave camp. I was wondering if you would like to do that.
    Would you like to become a member of Cthulhu Dawn, our guild?”
