    “Hey, Daeron!”
  </p>
  
  <p>
    “Howdy.”
  </p>
  
  <p>
    “Hi, Daeron.”
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Greetings came from all the guildies as Daeron blushed slightly at the warm welcome. 
    “Thanks! I…uh, I’m happy to join you guys. Also, I was wondering if any if you
    play the lute?” Holding up the instrument, he continued. “I found this one in the 
    wreckage, and just couldn’t bear to leave it even though I can’t play anything on it.”
  </p>

    Everyone looked around for a moment before Tarr spoke up. “I’ll take it. I’ve played 
    lute before. I’ll take good care of it. Will be nice to have music again,” he finished.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Smiling, Daeron passed him the lute. “Great! Glad I finally found it a new home.”
