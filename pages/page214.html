    Trauma spoke up from the back of the group. “Nice to have you with us, Daeron, but time
    is wasting, and we need to make some plans. Please sit and join us.” He waited for Raven
    and Daeron to sit down before continuing. “Raven and I spoke to Wilton this morning. He
    has done us a favor by allowing us to bring Daeron along. He also shared some information
    about how they get around out here—gliders.” Trauma paused as murmurs passed through the 
    crowd. “I know that this is something new for us, but Wilton says his men will show us how
    to construct and use them. So, for the next several days, we will be working hard on crafting
    gliders for everyone. We need them light-weight, fairly strong and portable. The dolyaks can 
    only carry so much, so let’s see if we can get a design that we can carry like a backpack. 
    Raven is working on getting a feel for the land here. We need to be as prepared as we can be. 
    Once we leave here, we have no idea what we’re facing. I don’t think we will find another
    encampment like this, so let’s make sure we are ready. Any questions?”
