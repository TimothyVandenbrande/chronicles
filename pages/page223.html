    Standing silently on the edge of the bridge, Raven looked at Dam and shook her 
    head. "I...I can't..." she whispered as he stared back. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    "Yes, you can. It's easy," Dam said, but he made no move to jump either.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    "If it's so easy, you do it then," Raven hissed. "I'm afraid of heights, and I
    can't feel my legs at the moment."
  </p>
  
  <p>
    "Well, I would, but I'm afraid of heights too. So, I guess we're gonna have to 
    jump together, Toots," Dam said with a grin.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    "Can we please just not jump at all?" she asked through clenched teeth.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    "Are you two gonna jump or just stand there all day?" Trauma asked after a few minutes.
