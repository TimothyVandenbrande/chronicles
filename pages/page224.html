    Jumping immediately behind her, they both shot upwards in the air. Raven could be heard
    swearing from the ground. Her words were unintelligible, but the meaning was very clear--she
    was not happy. Landing her glider after a few minutes of experimenting with the updraft,
    Raven walked to the edge of the cliff away from the bridge to be alone. She wanted to be
    mad at Dam for shoving her off, but she knew it was for the best, and honestly, gliding
    was pretty fun. Dam walked over to her and placed his hand on her shoulder.

    "Don't worry about it. I wanted to smack you at first, but after a few minutes in the air,
    I realized you were right after all. We're good," she said with a grin as she went to join
    the others. 	Grinning, Dam shook his head and followed her back to the group.
