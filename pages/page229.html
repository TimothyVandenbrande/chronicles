    and then west like we did when we were gliding. We can take that updraft we 
    practiced on, but not with the dolyaks. I hate to say it, Trauma, but I think 
    tomorrow, we need to divvy up the food and things among everyone and leave the
    dolyaks here. They'll only slow us down," she said as she paused to look at Trauma.

    "After that, the path isn't hard, but it is long. Trauma, I don't know how true it
    is, but Daeron says there is a lost city near here. Or at least, there are rumors of
    one. Apparently, all the scouts are talking about it, and Daeron says that even the
    Itzel, the frogs that Blood ran from, mention a set of ruins north and west of here.
    I think it is worth exploring. I mean, I know we need to get moving, but I can't 
    shake this feeling that we should go there. We could ask the others and see what 
    they think," she offered.
