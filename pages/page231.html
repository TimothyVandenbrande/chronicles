    unnecessary things as you can. Alex and Aura will sort the supplies and food, 
    Isomeik and Blood will hand it out so that everyone can pack. Any questions?"

    some information that she picked up while scouting. She's gonna share with you
    what she knows, and then we are gonna make a decision together on how best to 
    proceed. Understood?"
