    wreckage waiting for everyone to be ready. Heading through an opening in the rocks,
    the guild began descending a steep incline. Several guildies began gliding down
    instead of walking. Soon everyone was gliding, following the path around to the left,
    through an archway created by more Pact wreckage. Just passed the arch, the guildies
    landed and looked to Raven. "We go right; going left will only take us back to where
    we started," she said in answer to their questioning looks. "The path is narrow here.
    Mind your step, please." The group continued along the slope until they reached a small
    flat area hanging over the ravine. A small stone bridge continued to the right. It was 
    not very long and only wide enough for one person. "We never scouted quite this far before.
    I'll test the bridge, and then we can continue on." Whistling for her pets, Raven stepped 
    onto the bridge. Inching across it slowly, she felt no movement in the stonework. It seemed 
    sturdy enough. "Ok, guys. It seems fine," she said once she reached the other side.
