    "I don't care if it's ugly, but I do care if I can make it into a steak,"
    Dam said coming to look at the corpses. "I think it's edible. Anyone else 
    want a steak?"

    The guildies chimed in on whether or not they thought it was edible. Raven
    set about building a fire for the night while they discussed the fresh kill 
    at her feet. The guys soon sliced thick hunks of meat from the dead creatures.
    Finding sticks, they hung the meat above the flames to sear it to perfection.
    Raven munched on her cheese and apples as she watched with disgust as the fellas
    ate their 'jungle steaks.' Once everyone had dinner and sleeping mats were arranged
    around the fire for the night, Raven spoke up. "I think we are close to the area 
    for the city ruins. According to the information I picked up, the entrance should
    be over near the waterfall. I tried to look tonight, but the light was no good.
    We'll check it in the morning, but I have a good feeling about it."
