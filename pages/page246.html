    The evening was mostly quiet as the guildies sat around the fire chatting
    about what they thought could be in the abandoned city.  Suddenly, Ian 
    could be heard making a low groaning sound. Turning towards him, they waited
    to see if he would have a stronger reaction this time. "Stop talking to me!
    I hate you, and I won't be swayed! Aaaaaah!" Ian cried before slumping over.
    Reaching over to check him, Alex said, "He still has a pulse...well, if salads
    can have a pulse." Relaxing the group slowly began chatting again. Raven caught 
    Mondo's eye and gave him a knowing look. Shaking his head, Raven relaxed a bit.
    It is reassuring, and troublesome, that he doesn't hear the call like Ian does,
    she thought. Mondo and Alex carried Ian to his sleeping mat. A few of the others
    began to turn in as well.

    "Damn it! Every time, Aura," came the reply as a figure stepped into the firelight.
