    tomorrow," Trauma replied. "I think we should all get some sleep now. Something 
    tells me tomorrow might be a long day. Dam, you and Raven take first watch. Vayne 
    and Aura can take second watch. Night night."

    After Petter's arrival, there were no more surprises for the night. It passed quickly
    and quietly, as the jungle frogs croaked. The bugs chirped a peaceful tune, as birds
    called to each other from the canopy. Raven hoped this wasn't the calm before the storm
    as she woke Aura and Vayne for watch duty. Bidding the ladies good night, Raven went and
    laid down with her pets, but sleep would not find her. She couldn't shake the feeling 
    that tomorrow was gonna change things, and she wasn't sure that it was for the better.
    As dawn grew near, she gave up out of frustration, and joined the others on watch. The
    three sat silently staring at the dying fire until the sun came up. Nodding to each other,
    they moved to wake the others. Time to find out what was passed that waterfall.
