      The guildies stared at Raven in disbelief. There was no way she could have
      killed Mondo. No way he could have made her. Something wasn't right here. 
      Staring at each other uncomfortably, Tarr finally broke the silence. "I think
      we should make some fires and burn these corpses. It will be dark soon, and 
      I'm tired. Hungry too," the charr said with a chuckle.

      Breaking the remaining tension, Dam spoke up, "There might be more jungle steak
      left." The group began to move off, leaving Raven and Trauma standing alone. After
      they were gone, Trauma stood staring at Raven for a time. Speaking softly, he placed
      a hand on her shoulder. "Raven...I...what happened?" Still sniffling, she moved away
      from him. Pacing back and forth, she muttered to herself, never answering Trauma.
      Matching her pace, Trauma walked back and forth with her--over and over before he 
      finally stopped her.
