    "I was getting to that part," Alex said patiently. "The guy was pink...just like the
    quaggan. We'd seen what he had done to one quaggan, so we weren't sticking around 
    to see what he would do to us. We made it back to Iso at the fountain and just went
    back to splashing. Later that day, the guy found us at the fountain. He said that 
    he wanted to introduce himself and apologize for scaring us. He just wanted to have
    some fun. Turns out the quaggan wasn't real; his mom made him a backpack to look 
    like a quaggan 'cause he loves them so much. Anyways, he turned out to be really
    cool, and the best part is his pink moustache. You'll just have to see it to believe
    it. So, I think he will be a good addition to the guild," Alex finished proudly.
