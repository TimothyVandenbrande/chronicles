    No one had any questions, so Trauma dismissed them for the day. They walked out in
    small groups chatting about which direction they would explore first, wondering if 
    there was treasure to be had. When everyone had left, Raven still sat alone talking

    "Oh, I don't know. Maybe because you saw your friend die yesterday?" he 
    replied pointedly.
