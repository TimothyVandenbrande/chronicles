    Raven's face fell, deep wrinkles furrowing her brow. Looking in her lap,
    she fidgeted with her fingers as the silence filled the tavern. "I don't
    know what you want me to say, Trauma," she finally offered.

    "You could start with what happened yesterday. I know you said that Mondo 
    made you kill him, but I have been over it in my mind again and again, and
    I just can't understand what you mean by that."

    Still looking at her fingers, she answered, "He asked me to kill him, and I
    did. What more is there to explain?"

    "Raven, I know it can't be that simple. You're not the killing type, no offense. 
    There has to be a reason, and why would Mondo want to die? Do you understand that
    it just raises a lot of questions? Questions that I eventually need the answers to. 
    We all need the answers to. He was, and you still are, one of us," Trauma said 
    gently. "Please?"
