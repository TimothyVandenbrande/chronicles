    Mordremoth would take him. I begged him not to. I didn't want to kill 
    my friend, but he pleaded with me, and I gave in." Raven sighed softly

    "When Ian heard the voice again the night before we came here, Mondo 
    still heard nothing. We were relieved and worried still. Then, we came 
    here. During the fight, after Blood and I killed that snake thing, I 
    looked around to make sure everyone was ok. There was so much fighting, 
    so many enemies, so much chaos. I could find everyone but Mondo. I got 
    frantic," Raven's voice began to sound anxious as she continued. "I 
    finally spotted him. He was surrounded by those plant things. Two of 
    them were dragging him away from the group. I called his name, and he 
    yelled 'DO IT!' at me.  I refused and I ran towards them firing arrow 
    after arrow. He begged me to do it." Raven looked up at Trauma, tears 
    streaming down her face.
