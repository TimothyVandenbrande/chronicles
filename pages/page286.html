    face away from Trauma, she continued, her words harder to understand as
    she began to sob. "He said 'please,' and that was what did me in. I drew
    back as hard as I could, and I aimed for his heart. I couldn't...couldn't
    let him...suffer," she stopped as the sobbing took over. Drawing her knees
    to her chest, she rocked back and forth. "I...I...didn't want to kill him, 
    Trauma. Why? Why did he make me do it? Why?" Raven cried uncontrollably.
    Trauma placed his arm around her as she continued to cry. Once she had 
    cried herself out, she sat up straight again, and said, "I'm sorry, 
    Trauma. I didn't finish the story. After I shot Mondo, I dropped my bow,
    and hacked the enemies to death with my sword. I think I went a bit 
    overboard, but I was upset.
