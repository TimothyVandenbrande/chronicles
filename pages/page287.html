    After that, you guys found me, so you know what happened. I'm so sorry,
    Trauma. I didn't want to do it. I told him I was sorry before I fired. 
    I'm just so sorry. I..." Raven stopped because she didn't know what else
    to say. She looked up at Trauma, waiting for his reaction.

    "First of all, you have nothing to be sorry for. You were helping a friend, 
    and I think you did the right thing. He didn't want to be their pawn, and 
    you saved him from a lot of pain. You took the pain yourself in living with
    what you did, and I think that was very brave of you. Second, I don't hate 
    you. I don't think the others will hate you either when they find out. Don't
    be so hard on yourself. Mondo trusted you to do what he asked, and you did. 
    We can all respect you for that. Take some time to grieve, and get yourself 
    ready for the fight ahead. Then you can give Mordremoth exactly what he 
    deserves for taking your friend away. I'm, we're all, here if you need us. 
    Just say the word, ok?" Raven nodded her understanding
