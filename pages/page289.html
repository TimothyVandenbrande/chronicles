    wondering if we could send Nevermore with the messages now.

    "Sure thing. Did you write down what you wanted to send?" 
    she asked. Tarr nodded. "Ok, then let's see what we can do. 
    Come, Nevermore," she whistled for her bird. He perched on 
    lap. Removing a small metal tube from the pouch at her side, 
    Raven reached for Tarr's note. Rolling it up tightly, she 
    placed it inside the tube, screwing the lid down. Tying the 
    string tightly around Nevermore's leg, she whispered to the 
    bird. "Nevermore, I need you to deliver this message to Boar 
    in Hoelbrak. Do you remember, Boar? Big Norn?" Nevermore seemed 
    to nod his understanding as Raven spoke. "Good boy. Now fly as 
    fast as you can, ok? Stay high, stay safe. Deliver the message, 
    and return to me. Understand?" Again, the bird seemed to nod. 
    Placing a small kiss atop his head, Raven nodded for him to leave. 
    Nevermore took to the sky, and soon he was a distant speck.
