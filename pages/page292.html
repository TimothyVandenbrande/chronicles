    Trixie showed up the next day. After saying hello to everyone, 
    she followed Raven to a spot along the edge of the platform. The 
    two women sat for quite some time together as Raven told her what 
    happened to Mondo. Trixie hugged Raven as they both cried for 
    their fallen friend. While they were away, Trauma took the 
    opportunity to tell the others about Mondo as well. The guildies 
    glanced towards the women, and then dropped their heads as they 
    thought about what Trauma had said. Murmuring among themselves, 
    they soon straightened as Trixie and Raven joined them. Tarr reached 
    down and softly patted Trixie on the head as she stood before him. 
    Grabbing his paw, she returned his affection, looking up at him and 
    nodding. She turned back to look at Trauma as he spoke.

    "Now that we're all here..." Trauma began.

    "Excuse me. Excuse me. I hope I'm not late," came a voice outside the tavern.
