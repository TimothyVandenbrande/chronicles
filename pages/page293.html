    "Excuse me. Excuse me. I hope I'm not late," came a voice outside the tavern.

    "No, you're not. We're in here. Show yourself," Trauma said cautiously.

    Through the door of the tavern walked a norn, a very tall pink norn. The group 
    turned to look at him, and several gasped out loud. He wasn't a scary norn, but 
    he did have the largest, most perfect pink handlebar moustache the group had 
    ever seen. He quickly crossed the room and reached to shake Trauma's hand 
    enthusiastically. "I'm Turtar. I met Alex, Ian, and Iso in Lion's Arch. They said 
    that I could come hang out with you guys, and maybe smash some things. Nice to 
    meet you," he exclaimed. Accepting his hand cautiously, Trauma returned the 
    handshake, and replied, "It's um, nice to meet you too. You arrived just in time. 
    I was about to address the group, so join the others, and we'll get started." 
    Turtar nodded and went to stand in the back near Alex.
