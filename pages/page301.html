    "Me? Oh, yeah, sorry," Raven said as she came back to reality. Stepping 
    to the edge of the cliff, she pointed to the mountainside that they had 
    jumped from a few weeks ago. "We need to take the updrafts back up to 
    where we originally jumped off. I'll go first so that you can see where 
    I glide. Don't want anyone hurt," she finished with a whisper. "Everyone 
    ready?" Nodding at Raven, the group agreed. "Ok, here goes nothing," she 
    said as she stepped off the edge, opening her glider immediately. Gliding 
    straight across the chasm, Raven finally caught an updraft right before 
    she would have hit rock. Allowing it to lift her, she turned left and 
    caught a smaller updraft. Another left and she was lifted high into the 
    clouds by a second large updraft. Gliding smoothly, she landed back near 
    the waterfall where they had stood before. Once she was safe on the ground, 
    Trauma directed the others to follow, one at a time, until he was the only 
    one left. As he watched Dam touch down, he headed for the updrafts, anxious 
    to be underway.
