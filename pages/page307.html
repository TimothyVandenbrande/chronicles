    "I don't venture far from here, but I have heard some things from 
    others. This place is full of creatures just itching to eat you, 
    so be on the lookout. Also, there are Priory groups scattered about 
    studying all these strange pylons. I've heard there is a golden city 
    south of here. Lots of floaty people living there. Maybe they can 
    tell you more about Mordremoth. Don't know much more than that. 
    Just watch your back, and I think you'll be just fine," she finished 
    as she looked up at the group. "You seem a fine group of people, even 
    if you aren't asura."

    "One of us is asura!"
  </p>

    "Well, I stand corrected! A fine group of people even though you only 
    have one asura. Now move on. I have people to stitch back together. 
    Time is wasting!"
