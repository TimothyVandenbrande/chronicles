    The group took a marked path that lead east away from the Pact camp. 
    It led down, and they soon stood in a clearing. At the other side of 
    the clearing, was another marked path that continued down. This was 
    the pattern of the terrain until they reached a fourth clearing. Just 
    beyond that clearing was a large golden structure. From where they 
    stood, it looked like a temple of some sort. Trauma held up his hand 
    for them to stay put. Nodding to Raven, he motioned for her and the 
    scouts to move forward. Glaring at him, she took Dam and Likoi and 
    moved along the outer edge of the open area. They didn't have to go 
    far before they could see everything. Raven sent Likoi and Dam back 
    to Trauma. Following slowly, she took in the area one last time.  
    Likoi and Dam were telling the others what they had seen when Raven 
    returned to the group.

    "What took you so long?" Trauma asked when he saw her. "Did something 
    happen?"
