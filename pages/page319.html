    Raven told Blood to tell Trauma that the snake was taken care of. 
    Searching around she found all the guildies. All of them but Mondo. 
    Where was Mondo? He has to be here somewhere Raven thought in a 
    panic. Where is he? Finally, she spotted him being drug away by 
    mordrem. Mondo!! "Save me!" he yelled. Raven began chasing after 
    them. Firing, she watched Mondo go over the cliff screaming. The 
    mobs all turned towards Raven. Soon they all had Mondo's face. 
    They were advancing towards her chanting "Murderer! Murderer! 
    How could you kill me?" "NOOOOOO!!!!" Raven screamed in panic. 
    She began running away. Over and over she screamed "NOOOOO!! I 
    didn't mean to! I'm sorry!"

    Dam shook Raven awake. "What are you sorry for, Toots? Waking 
    me up with your screams?" Blinking, Raven looked at Dam, 
    confusion clear on her face.
