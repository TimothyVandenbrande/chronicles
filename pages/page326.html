    The group milled about the pylon, climbing the scattered boulders 
    and mirrors trying to pass the time. Dam inspected wild plants, 
    while Iso and Likoi held a dagger throwing contest. Ian blinked 
    around daring Alex to catch him. The charr pounced on the sylvari, 
    and their game continued for most of the afternoon. Vayne and Aura 
    walked in circles around the pylon lost in conversation. Raven sat 
    on the edge of the platform, staring into space. Trauma paced the 
    length of the pylon back and forth. The group tried to pass the time 
    as easily as they could. They were anxious to be on their way, but 
    they did not want to be rude and lose the help of the exalted. After 
    several hours, they spotted Burnisher Kengo floating back up the path.

    "Sorry to keep you waiting, Trauma Reaper," the exalted began, "but 
    the Luminate was indisposed when I went, and I was forced to wait."

    "No problem. We managed to pass the time comfortably," he replied.
