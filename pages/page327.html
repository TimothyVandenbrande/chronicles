    "The Luminate has agreed to see you. In fact, she seemed rather 
    excited to learn that you were here. She has asked that I escort 
    you to the city as quickly as possible. Are you and your guild 
    ready to leave?" Kengo asked.

    "Yes, we are. Just lead the way, and we will follow you," Trauma said.

    "Excellent. Let us depart then. It is not a long walk and you are most 
    anxiously awaited."

    Nodding, Trauma motioned the others to fall in behind. They followed 
    the exalted down the path away from the pylon and into the jungle. They 
    did not know what was in store for them in the city, but they were ready 
    to face it. After a short walk, the exalted pointed to an archway. The 
    group saw light through the archway, but could not make out anything 
    else. "Welcome to Tarir, Cthulhu Dawn. You are our honored guests. I 
    hope that you find everything that you are looking for."
