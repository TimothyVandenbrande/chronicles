    The guild reluctantly tore themselves away from the view and 
    began to follow the exalted. Going right off of the terrace, 
    they went down another set of stairs and turned left into an 
    archway. Another set of stairs brought them into a candlelit 
    room. A door to the left led them down even more stairs. Two
    sets of stairs later, they were in yet another candlelit room. 
    "Does this place ever end?" Iso grumbled under her breath. 
    "I don't think so, and my feet are starting to hurt," Likoi 
    whispered back. The room opened onto another terrace, and the 
    group realized that they were closer to the center of the city. 
    They could see all of the golden towers and rooms better, and it 
    was amazing. Beautiful stained glass created intricate windows 
    in the rooms.

    Making a noise to get their attention, Kengo pointed to a narrow 
    path. "We must continue," she said as she led the way. The narrow 
    path opened onto a wide, golden platform that led through an archway 
    to even more stairs. Five flights of stairs later, they reach a small
    altar. On top of it sat a golden box with a plaque.
