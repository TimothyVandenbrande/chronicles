  <p>Vayne straightened as she prepared to tell her friends what she knew. “Well, I know that they’ve been trying to keep it quiet, but Trauma, there’s a dragon loose. Mordremouth is emerging…it’s getting ugly fast. The Pact is sending troops in, but I don’t think it will work. It’s going to be a slaughter unless we do something, and do it fast. I hate to say it, but we need to call everyone in, and I mean, everyone. Boar, Alex, Petter…Trauma, we have to bring them all back.</p>
