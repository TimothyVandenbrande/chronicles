    he agreed.

    Nodding, Raven stripped off her boots and bags of gear. Leaving her 
    bow behind, she took only her sword and warhorn for protection. Swimming 
    across the small pool, she climbed the bank and approached the marking. 
    Nodding to the guild, she whispered, "Here goes nothing," and touched 
    the mark. Instantly she was teleported to the other side of the magical 
    wall. She waved at her friends through the wall to let them know she was 
    safe. Then padding down the path in her bare feet, she began to look 
    around. At the end of the path, she found a golden archway with a magical 
    portal in the center. It shimmered exactly like the one to their guild hall. 
    Curious about where it led, she knew better than to go alone. Turning around, 
    she went back to the wall and touched the marking on this side.  It took her 
    back to her friends. She swam across to them and relayed what she saw.
