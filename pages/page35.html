    “Well, I was looking over my information last night, and I think I have come up with the best
    plan for retrieving the first group of guildies. Dam, I need you to go to Snowden Drifts to get Tibbia.
    She’s studying at Scholar’s Cleft. On the way, I can give you a contact to meet with to find Petter,” Vayne began.

  <p>“Ok. I can handle that. Anything else I need to know or get?” Dam asked.</p>

    “No, you are traveling far enough. Just concentrate on getting them,” she replied. Turning to
    Raven, she continued, “I need you to get Tarr and Trixie. Tarr is a good friend of Boar’s, and I know he’ll help us. 
    They are supposed to be in Gendarran Fields, near the border. I’ll see if I can get you better information before you
    leave,” Vayne continued.

    “Sure, I can do that. I met Tarr once. He’s pretty cool for a charr. I can’t wait to see Trixie. I kinda
    miss the little rat,” Raven answered.
