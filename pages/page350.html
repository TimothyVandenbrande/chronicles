    the one leading into their new guild hall.

    "No clue, but we are about to find out. I assume we will do 
    this like we did with the guild hall.  Aura, can you prepare a 
    portal, and check what is on the other side?" Trauma asked.

    Stepping through, she disappeared from sight. The others stood

    through her own portal.
