    "Well, I was in an underground cave. There seemed to be a 
    small city or something there, but I didn't go far. It was 
    a long walk to get to the city, and I didn't want to go it 
    alone. There was mostly water near the entrance. I came back 
    through my portal because it was faster than walking back over 
    the bridges I found. There is definitely a weird vibe in there, 
    though. Strange magic in that place. I think we'll find our bad 
    guy in there," she finished.

    Nodding, Trauma turned to the others. "Who's ready to do some 
    exploring?"
  </p>

    "Me!!' came the response from the group.

    Motioning towards the magical gate, Trauma said, "Then step inside, 
    and let's have some fun." One by one, the guild walked through ready 
    to face whatever was on the other side.
