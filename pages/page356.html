    Trauma instructed. "Blood, I need you to stay here near the stairs 
    and secure our escape route. If anyone gets near these stairs that 
    is not CD, you shoot it--dead. Each group secure their building, 
    and we'll meet near the center of the platform when we are done. 
    I want to know what is up that next set of stairs I see over there.
    Any questions?"

    When no one made a sound, Trauma silently dismissed them with a 
    wave of his hand. Raven's group quickly ran up the last couple 
    stairs and turned left. They immediately descended a staircase and 
    saw a golden building with more stairs leading into it. Open windows 
    revealed mordrem moving about in the room. Not knowing what the 
    room was used for, they quickly and quietly climbed the steps, 
    and Raven peeked around the corner. There were tables and chairs, 
    even a bar for the absent bartender. Sliding back to the group, she
    whispered, "It's looks like a tavern in there. They are actually 
    sitting around talking like normal people."
