    Tonight, today, whichever it is," he said with 
    a chuckle, "this place is ours. Let us rest before we begin the journey back to 
    the Luminate. We've earned it after such a well fought battle. Let's find a place 
    to start a fire, and Tarr can play us a victory song after dinner." The guild 
    cheered and gave each other high fives for a job well done. Raven sat on the edge 
    of the group, resting her throat, and thinking. She felt a little bit lighter 
    after this. We did it, Mondo, she thought. We made the world a little safer. I 
    miss you, but I'll keep fighting cause it's worth it. Smiling at her guildmates, 
    she realized that she still had a lot here worth fighting for. Her guild 
    needed her, and she definitely needed them. It was time to end this, and time to 
    avenge what they had lost. Look out, Mordi, she thought. We're coming for you, 
    and you're not gonna win!
