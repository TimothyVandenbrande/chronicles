    Sometime later, the guild began their journey back to the Luminate. Being underground for so
    long, they had no idea how much time had passed. Stepping back through the magical portal, they once
    again worked their way under the city to the hole. Using the bouncing mushrooms there, they landed in the
    center of Tarir just as the sun was coming up. The pale light barely filtered down into the city, but the
    gilded architecture was still softly glowing in the beams. They worked their way back to the Luminate’s
    throne room. By the time they reached her, it was mid-morning. Ian waved to the guild as they
    approached, and the Luminate turned to greet them.

    “Hey, guys!” Ian said brightly. “How did it go? Good, right? I feel much better so it must have.”
