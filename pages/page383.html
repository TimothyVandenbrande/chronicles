    “I understand. Please stay here tonight and rest. My followers will see to your needs and make
    sure that your food stores are replenished before you leave. We do not eat, but we do keep stores for
    travelers like yourselves. I wish there was more information that I could offer you on the elder dragon,

    must return to my duties at the moment, but I will be available later,” she said.
