    “Come back here, silly. Dam was just kidding, weren’t you?” Raven said as she called her pet back.
    “Come, sleep.” Perking up, the wyvern bounded happily into Raven’s lap before settling down beside
    her. He seemed to give Dam a look as he settled down between Raven and Trauma. “I think you hurt his
    feelings,” Raven said as she laid down to sleep.
