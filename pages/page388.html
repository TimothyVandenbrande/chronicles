  <p>    “Excuse me,” she began, “but we need to leave the city and head south in the morning. Can you    please tell us the best way to do that?”  </p>  <p>    “Certainly,” the exalted replied. “You need to leave through Southgate. If you go back down to    the floor below the throne room, you will find one of our portal stones. Touch it and appear in the    courtyard below. Make your way to the center of the city. Turn right and you will be heading south.    Cross the courtyard there, and once again use the portal stone. This will take you to our Southgate, and    from there, you may leave the city and continue your journey.”  </p>  <p>“Thank you very much,” Raven replied.</p>  <p>“You are most welcome,” returned the exalted before giving a nod and resuming his duties.</p></div><span class="page-number">388</span>
