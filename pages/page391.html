    creatures came flooding out from all directions running towards the
    guild and away from Nevermore. Drawing weapons, the group aimed for the animals. They were quick
    and weaved in and out among their feet. “Sparklefly, fetch,” Raven called. The wyvern dodged forward
    and charged through the swarm. Knocking them to the ground, he grabbed one and brought it back to
    Raven. The guild managed to kill the others after Sparklefly stunned them.

    Sitting happily at Raven’s feet, Sparklefly offered her the still wiggling creature. Reaching for it,
    Raven suddenly drew her fingers back. “Shit! It almost bit me!” she exclaimed. “Kill!” she told her pet.
    Not wasting a second, Sparklefly clamped his jaws closed, instantly breaking the creature’s neck. Spitting
    it out on the ground, he waited for praise. Laughing, Raven patted his head, telling him how good he
    was before turning towards the animal at her feet. It had two legs and two small arms. It resembled a
    miniature dinosaur with a small tail and long jaws filled with teeth.
