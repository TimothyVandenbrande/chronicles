    friend. Aura often made her laugh with some party trick. Ian was her ward, and
    made her proud as he learned and developed his craft more each day. Alex had a 
    kind heart and gentle demeanor that Raven adored. Blood was pretty new to the 
    guild, but her brash, slightly silly manner was endearing. Iso and Likoi 
    constantly made her laugh with their showmanship and bravado. Daeron was
    also new, but there was something about his polite demeanor, and corny jokes 
    that Raven found cute. Tarr was a wise and kind warrior that others knew they 
    could depend on. Dam was smart, funny, and always had a suggestion for what to 
    do next. Then there was Trauma. He was the leader of Cthulhu Dawn, and a kind, 
    fair man, even though he would have most people believe he was an evil, heartless 
    monster. Not one to be crossed, Trauma cared for those close to him, and Raven 
    admired him-- especially for his dedication to protecting his guild.  Sighing,
