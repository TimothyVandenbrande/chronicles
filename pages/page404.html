   <h1>Chapter 15</h1>

  <p class="capital">
    Lining up as they had been, Raven took point with Dam beside her. Walking away from the
    shelter, she followed the direction the Nuhoch had mentioned the night before. They hadn’t traveled far
    when they came to a fast-moving stream. Rocks were scattered throughout, and Raven nimbly jumped
    across them to the other side. She waited as the others followed her path across. Once everyone had
    made it, they continued along the trail before them. A couple mordrem were stalking along the path.
    Raven held up her hand for the group to stop. “Blood,” she whispered. “Hmm?” came the reply. Pointing
    to the mordem, Raven said, “I’ll take the right.” Nodding, Blood notched an arrow, aiming for the one on
    the left. “Now,” Raven said as they let fire their arrows, simultaneously taking out the mordrem. The
    group moved forward and checked the bodies.
