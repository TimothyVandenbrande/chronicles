    creature gave one last scream and teetered above them. “Run! Its gonna fall,” Raven shouted as she

    “No way! It’s my lucky dagger!” he cried as he continued to yank on it. Suddenly, the creature
    died and dropped to the ground, crushing Likoi beneath it. Running forward, the group began shoving at

    budge. Lifting up the head, Tarr looked under and called Likoi’s name. Just then, the asura burst out
    from under the bug. “Got it!” he yelled triumphantly as he collapsed to the ground panting. “Man, that
    thing is fat,” he said with a laugh. “Didn’t think I was ever getting out of that bug.”
