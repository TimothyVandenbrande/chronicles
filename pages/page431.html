  <p>“Thank you very much. We’ll talk again in the morning if you don’t mind,” Trauma said.</p>  <p>    “Not at all. I can show you around and answer all your questions. It’s nice to know someone has    come to get rid of the dragon. Sleep well, and I’ll see you in the morning,” Vanhe said with a small nod.  </p>  <p>    “I’ll see you first thing in the morning. Good night,” Trauma said, returning her nod before    leading the guild to the tents. “Spread out among the tents. They seem to hold two or three people    each. Grab a snack, and get some rest. We’ll make better sense of it all tomorrow. Job well done today.    I’m proud of how far we’ve come, but now it’s nap time. Night night,” Trauma said before disappearing    into the first tent. Raven and Dam joined Trauma, tossing their bags in front of the tent as they laid out    their sleeping gear. Ian, Iso, and Likoi took the other three-person tent. Vayne and Aura took a tent    beside them, with Alex and Boar claiming the one behind that.  </p></div><span class="page-number">431</span>
