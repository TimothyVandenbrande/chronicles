  <p class="capital">
    In the morning, Trauma awoke to a figure standing over him. Rubbing his eyes, he looked again.
  </p>

  <p>“About time you woke up,” Petter said cheerfully. “I’ve been waiting for hours.”</p>

  <p>“Hours? Really?” Trauma asked in disbelief.</p>

  <p>
    “Nah, not really hours, but glad you are up. We’ve got a dragon to kill,” Petter said as he waited
    for Trauma to get up.
  </p>

  <p>
    “I’m coming. I’m coming,” Trauma said. “Go wake the others while I get reacquainted with the
    sunshine,” Trauma grumbled.
  </p>

  <p>“Will do,” Petter said with a salute as he moved off</p>
