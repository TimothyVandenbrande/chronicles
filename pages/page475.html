    “Mmmm, pizza,” Raven agreed. “Damn, you’re gonna make me hungry again, Alex.” Grinning,

    twisted under her in a strange angle. Rushing forward, Raven checked her over. “She’s still breathing,
    but she is out cold, Trauma,” Raven called. “I’m pretty sure that she broke her arm in the fall, but I don’t
    want to move her.”

    Nodding, Trauma kept an eye on the face before them. A large snort cleared the air around it,
    and they could finally see what they were dealing with.
