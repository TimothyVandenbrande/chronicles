    <h1>Chapter 7</h1>

    <p class="capital">Leaving Black Haven, Dam crossed into Gendarran Fields. Skirting the Lawen Ponds, a swamp known to be full of undead, he passed First Haven, and continued on. His morning passed uneventfully, and he soon found himself in Cornucopian Fields, a small farming community just outside of Lion’s Arch. Strolling through the town, he looked for a small inn. Vayne told him to check in with an Innkeeper Tallatha. She would have more information about Petter. Spotting the inn, he walked in and sat on a barstool. A sylvari with purple leaves asked him what he wanted to drink. </p>
    <p>“I’ll have a beer, and a word with your innkeeper, please,” he answered.</p>
    <p>Setting a mug in front of him, she replied, “Here you go, and here is the innkeeper. What can I do ya for?”</p>
