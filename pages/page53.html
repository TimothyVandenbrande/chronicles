    “Goodnight,” Dam said to her retreating figure. He noticed a small fire had been made in the
    room, and the bed was ready for him. “These Priory folk think of everything, I guess,” he thought as he
    set his bags in the corner. Sitting on the edge of the bed, he removed his boots and extra layers. Setting
    them aside, he laid down on the bed, and quickly fell into a dreamless sleep.

    The next morning, Dam rose to find the fire had died down in his room, and there was a slight
    chill in the air. Rising, he dressed quickly and stretched his muscles. Four days’ travel had left him a bit
    sore. Leaving his room, he wandered back into the main room. After warming himself near the fire, he
    glanced through the bookcases. “Hmmm… ‘Hylek Poisons and Their Effects on Tree Bark,’ ‘Griffon
    Feathers and Where Not to Use Them.’ Wow, they research everything,” Dam thought with a chuckle.
    Looking up from the bookcase, he spotted Scholar Elyse.
