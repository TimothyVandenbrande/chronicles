    <h1>Chapter 8</h1>

    <p class="capital">The next morning, Dam awoke to a chill in the air. Searching his pack for an extra layer, he threw on the gear and headed out. Crossing Bitterfrost Peaks, he finally made it over the border into Snowden Drifts. The snow covering the ground was slowing him down. He stopped at the first lodge he saw and double checked directions up to Scholar’s Cleft. 	He didn’t want lost in the snow at dark. Following the road north towards what the Norn told him was Ossencrest Climb, he finally saw a small Seraph camp. Spotting a scout at the edge of the camp, he asked, “Excuse me. Am I close to Scholar’s Cleft?”</p>
    <p>“Why, yessir. Just over that last ridge north of here you’ll find Scholar’s Cleft. Nothing there but Priory folk though,” the soldier replied. </p>
