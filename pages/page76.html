    Morning came early as the camp was abuzz with activity even before dawn. Raven sat up on her
    elbows and looked around her. Sparklefly and Nevermore were still at the front of the tent, but they
    were wide awake, eagerly watching the men move around the post. Turning to Mondo, Raven realized
    he wasn’t in the tent. “Hmmm, must be up exploring,” she thought to herself. “I hope he finds food in
    the process.” Her stomach growled in agreement. “The curse of always being hungry,” she muttered as
    she stood and patted the boys on their heads. “Sleep well, my pets?” she asked as they nuzzled her legs.
    “Good. Now let’s go find Mondo and begin the search for our other friends.”

    She soon found Mondo perched atop a pole near some stairs. He was angled in such a way to
    watch the camp and to stare into, what appeared to be, a very large hole in the ground. Once beside
    him, she asked, “Sooo what’s so interesting in the hole? And PLEASE tell me you found breakfast.”
