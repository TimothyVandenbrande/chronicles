    “Ah, well then, well met Mondo. Raven, I remember meeting you once before. Shall we head
    back to camp so that we can talk? I have a match this afternoon, and I am sure you have many questions
    for me.”

    “Yes, please,” Raven answered. “After you.” They followed the charr and asura out of the cave
    through a second entrance. Cautiously watching the oozes as they passed, she exchanged glances with
    Mondo, who only shrugged in reply.

    The group walked in silence back to Stoneguard Gate. Crossing the stream as they did that
    morning, they were soon amongst the tents of the outer camp. The sun was at its highest point, and
    Raven could smell food. Her stomach growling, she was grateful when Tarr and Likoi headed for the
    kitchen tent. The group got their lunch and chose a table tucked in the corner so they could talk in
    relative privacy.
