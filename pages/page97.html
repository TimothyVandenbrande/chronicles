  <p>“Sure thing, Trauma,” Vayne said. “Safe travels. Good luck, and I’ll see you back at the fort.”</p>

  <p>
    “Will do. Give my best to Aura,” Trauma said with a grin as he strode off down the streets of the
    city.

    Heading the opposite direction, Vayne went in search of lodgings for the night. Crossing through
    the city center, Vayne soon saw the familiar gates of the Salma District. Walking through the tree-lined
    courtyard, Vayne came to Rook’s Row. A tavern with some rooms to rent, Rook’s Row was run by
    Andrew and his daughter Petra. As soon as she stepped through the door, Vayne felt more at ease,
    almost at home. It was good to be back in Divinity’s Reach, even for a little bit. Petra called out to Vayne
    from behind the bar. Running around the end of the bar, she embraced Vayne, almost knocking her
    over.

  <p>“Long time, no see, stranger,” Petra squealed as she looked at Vayne. “You staying for long?”</p>
